This library leverages the power of Tealium's [AudienceStream™](http://tealium.com/products/audiencestream/) making them natively available to Swift applications. 

Please contact your Account Manager first to verify your agreement(s) for licensed products.


### What is Audience Stream ?

Tealium AudienceStream™ is the leading omnichannel customer segmentation and action engine, combining robust audience management and profile enrichment capabilities with the ability to take immediate, relevant action.

AudienceStream allows you to create a unified view of your customers, correlating data across every customer touchpoint, and then leverage that comprehensive customer profile across your entire digital marketing stack.


## How To Get Started

* Check out the [Getting Started](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Mobile-Libraries/Mobile-170-Getting-Started-with-Swift/ta-p/15489) guide for a step by step walkthough of adding Tealium to an extisting project.  
* The public API can viewed online [here](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Mobile-Libraries/Tealium-Swift-APIs/ta-p/15492), it is also provided in the Documentation directory of this repo as html and docset for Xcode and Dash integration.
* There are many other useful articles on our [community site](https://community.tealiumiq.com).


## Tealium Swift Library Modules

This library employs a drag-and-drop modular architecture when the source files are referenced directly (vs. using a dependency manager).

### What is a module?

Each subfolder within the *Tealium/* folder is a module, each contains at least a subclass of the TealiumModule class and any additional classes to provide a given feature set to the library. 

The core module provides the base public APIs and coordinates all other modules. It  automatically initializes each of these modules if they are referenced in a target build.


### Required Modules

The core module is the only required component of the library.  Howevever, no dispatch calls will be made without a dispatch service module, ie the collect or [tag management](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Mobile-Libraries/Tealium-Swift-Module-TagManagement/ta-p/16857) module.

### Modules List

The following table lists the currently available modules and related details.  
* *Name:* of Module.
* *Feature:* What enhancement the module provides.
* *Priority:* Modules initialization and processing order. Currently goes from lowest to highest value (this will be flipped in a future release for clarity).
* *Included:* Is the module part of the default .framework build for dependency managers (ie [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)).
* *Platforms:* Which platforms the module is compatible with.
* *Notes:* Any additional information.
